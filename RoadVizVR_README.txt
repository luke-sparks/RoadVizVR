ROADVIZVR
# Developed by Kasey Davis, Max Marciel, Luke Sparks, and Nathan Vanos

# The Program:
    RoadVizVR is a virtual reality tool for visualizing roadway designs. 
    RoadVizVR gives the designer a wonderful, detailed visualization experience
    through a system of building virtual roads that is both intuitive and simplistic. 
    Users of RoadVizVR can build road designs through inserting and removing
    lanes in their road, adjusting the width and type of those lanes. Furthermore, RoadVizVR 
    allows for a more in depth visualization experience through powerful UI, 
    placement of props and moving vehicles on lanes, and adjustment of environmental
    factors around the road. RoadVizVR even goes a step further by allowing users to save
    their designs so they can return to them at a later date!

# VR Platforms: 
    - SteamVR 
    - Oculus 

# The Developers:
    The four developers are college students who built this program as a senior design 
    project. Each developer made significant contributions to bring this program to life.
        - Kasey: designed UI and UI interactions. 
        - Luke: designed laser pointer interactions, prop placement, and textures.
        - Max: designed vehicle movement and environmental factors.
        - Nathan: designed lane and stripe functionality and the system for saving and loading.

# Sponsor: Rhonda Young
    Dr. Young is a Professor at Gonzaga University who originally envisioned this application. 
    She intended it for use in roadway design in the Spokane community, but also believed
    it had the potential for more widespread use. 

# Other Contributors:
    - Dr. Kate Schroeder, the faculty advisor on this project, regularly met with the developers
      to ensure their work was accomplished on schedule. She also helped them plan the implementation
      of certain features. 
    - Michael Herzog, the Design Advisory Board member for this project. Assisted developers with 
      the organization of their schedule and sprint release plans.
