Stripe Class Description: Stripe is used for controlling the behavior of individual stripes
                          (stripeContainer).This includes setting their type, position, and orientation. 


A. Libraries:
    1. System.Collections.
    2. System.Collections.Generic.
    3. UnityEngine.

B. Class Fields:
    1. currentStripeType:
        a. Type: private string.
        b. Serialized: yes. 
        c. Description: the name of the stripe type that the stripe container is set to.
        d. Usage: used to create easy access to the name of the stripe's current type. 

    2. stripe:
        a. Type: private GameObject.
        b. Serialized: yes. 
        c. Description: a reference to the stripe that the stripeContainer is currently displaying in the 
                        development environment. 
        d. Usage: used to control which stripe type the stripeContainer is set to. 

    3. leftLane:
        a. Type: private GameObject.
        b. Serialized: yes.
        c. Description: a reference to the stripe's left lane (the lane that this is
                        the right stripe of).
        d. Usage: used as a reference for the left lane. 

    4. rightLane: 
        a. Type: private GameObject.
        b. Serialized: yes. 
        c. Description: a reference to the stripe's right lane (the lane that this is
                        the left stripe of).
        d. Usage: used a reference for the right lane. 

    5. stripeTypes:
        a. Type: array of GameObject.
        b. Serialized: yes. 
        c. Description: stores the stripe prefabs that can be instantiated by stripeContainer.
        d. Usage: used to provide setStripeType() with a quick and efficient way of switching
                  the stripe's type. 
 
C. Public Methods:
    1. setStripePosition():
        a. Type: public void.
        b. Parameters: 
            i. Vector3 lanePosition.
            ii. float adjustment, the amount that the stripe is to be moved by. 
        c. Variables:
            i. Vector3 tempVec.
        d. Description: updates the stripe's position. 
        e. Usage: used by Road and BasicLane to update a stripe's position after a lane is moved
                  or altered. 

    2. setStripeType():
        a. Type: public void.
        b. Parameters: 
            i. string newType, the type that the stripe is going to be set to. 
            ii. Vector3 newStripePosition, used only to instantiate a new stripe object. 
        c. Variables:
            i. GameObject newStripe, the reference to the new stripe object instantiated from the 
               prefab in stripeTypes whose name matches newType.
        d. Description: sets a stripe's type by destroying the old stripe in the stripeContainer, 
                        then instantiating a new one and setting its position. 
        e. Usage: used by other scripts to change a stripe's type. 

    3. getStripeType():
        a. Type: public string.
        b. Parameters: none.
        c. Variables: none.
        d. Description: returns currentStripeType.
        e. Usage: used by other scripts to access name of the stripe's type.

    4. getStripeObject():
        a. Type: public GameObject.
        b. Parameters: none.
        c. Variables: none.
        d. Description: returns stripe.
        e. Usage: used by other scripts to access the actual stripe object in the stripeContainer.

    5. setLaneOrientation():
        a. Type: public void.
        b. Parameters: 
            i. GameObject lane, the lane we are setting the orientation of. 
            ii. string laneOrientation.
        c. Variables: none. 
        d. Description: sets lane to be either leftLane or RightLane depending on the value of
                        laneOrientation.
        e. Usage: used by setStripeOrientation() in BasicLane to set the lane as either the left
                  or right lane of this stripe after this stripe's orientation has been set for lane.

    6. getStripeTypes():
        a. Type: public List<GameObject>.
        b. Parameters: none.
        c. Variables: List<GameObject> stripeTypesList, stripeTypes casted as a list. 
        d. Description: casts stripeTypes as a list then returns it.
        e. Usage: used by other scripts to access all possible stripe types. 

    7. loadStripeAtts():
        a. Type: public void.
        b. Parameters: 
            i. StripeData savedStripe, stripe data for this stripe from a loaded road file.
        c. Variables: none.
        d. Description: sets the stripe type of this stripe to be the type stored in savedStripe.
        e. Usage: used to load the type of an individual stripe when loadRoad() in Road is invoked. 

D. Private Methods: 
    1. findStripeType():
        a. Type: private GameObject.
        b. Parameters: 
            i. string stripeType.
        c. Variables: none.
        d. Description: returns the GameObject stored in stripeTypes whose name matches stripeType.
        e. Usage: helper function for setStripeType() that retrieves the stripe object 
                  that stripe is to be set to.
